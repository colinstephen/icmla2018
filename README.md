# Sinkhorn Divergence of Topological Signature Estimates for Time Series Classification

## About

This repository contains Sklearn-compatible (Python) code for computing per-class persistent homology kernel density estimates for time series classification problems.

## Reuse

If you wish to reuse or adapt any of this code please cite the following paper.

## Caveat

This code is in a 'research-level' state. Probably worse. Thus it is under-documented and lots of hacking will be required to get it to work. Nevertheless, you may find something useful.
